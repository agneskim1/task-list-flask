Task List

There's so much we want to do in the world! When we organize our goals into smaller, bite-sized tasks, we'll be able to track them more easily, and complete them!

If we make a web API to organize our tasks, we'll be able to create, read, update, and delete tasks as long as we have access to the Internet and our API is running!

We also want to do some interesting features with our tasks. We want to be able to:

- Sort tasks
- Mark them as complete
- Get feedback about our task list through Slack
- Organize tasks with goals
